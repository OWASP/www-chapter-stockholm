## Past Events
**`OWASP``   ``Stockholm``   ``meeting,``   ``May``   ``25``
 ``2022:``   ``OWASP``   ``DevSecOps with GitLab Security`**

Welcome to another live OWASP Stockholm event and get together sponsored by Sentor

Cyber attacks have never been more in the news. From Twitter hacks to identity theft, vulnerabilities are exposing gaps in the application development process. Application security is difficult, especially when security is a separate process from your DevOps workflow. Security has traditionally been the final hurdle to conquer in the development lifecycle.

Join this session to gain a better understanding of how to successfully shift security left to find and fix security flaws during development - and to do so more easily and with greater visibility and control than typical approaches can provide.

Stefania will explore:

* How to achieve comprehensive security scanning - without adding a bunch of new tools and processes
* How to secure and protect your cloud native applications and IaC environments within existing DevOps workflows
* How to use a single-source-of-truth to improve collaboration between dev and sec
* How to manage all of your software vulnerabilities in one place
* How to automate and monitor your security policies and simplify auditing
* How to set up compliance pipelines to provide consistent guardrails for developers and ensure separation of duties

This meeting will be both physical and virtual, therefore it is important that you register for the correct event. Choose the physical event if you will be attending in person to see Stefania's presentation or choose the virtual event if you will be watching the presentation online through a zoom meeting.

 Welcome to our first digital event for 2022 where we will be hosting two talks!

Talk 1:
Priviledged Identity Management (PIM) – Closing the door after you are done with work

Description: How do you make sure that while you are sleeping, no-one is using a priviledged account to access important resources within the organisation? In this session i share the approch i use to handle such scenarios and how to limit access to resources just-in-time as they are needed. Some of the technologies covered are Azure AD, Azure AD PIM.

Presenter: Taavi Koosaar, VP Engineering at Chinsay AB
MS MVP - Developer Technologies and passionate about development technologies, architecture, DevSecOps, processes and engineering practices in general to deliver software and value continuously in a cloud native world.

Talk 2:
Stop the looters: a method to detect and stop digital skimming attacks

Description: In 2019 British Airways was fined a remarkable £183 million for a data breach that affected more than 380.000 of its customers. Magecart, the hacking group behind the attack, specializes in credit card theft using a technique called digital skimming and British Airways has not been their solo victim. How can we detect these attacks? Is there a method to detect and stop digital skimmers? In this talk we present a technique to do this.

Presenter: Nikolaos (Nikos) Alexiou has worked with application security since 2017 in finance and healthcare. He has a software engineering background and he is currently a member of the leadership team for the Stockholm OWASP local chapter. Nikos holds an MSc in Information Systems from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

Session 2. Benefits of Cloud Thinking
Are Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) becoming the new normal? Should we get used to businesses getting pawned and having sensitive data leaked? Absolutely not! In this talk, we will present how designs often used in the cloud not only reduces risk of APTs, but also improve overall quality of your application – regardless if you’re running in the cloud or not.

Bio
Daniel Deogun & Dan Bergh Johnsson are authors of the book Secure by Design and have collectively been working with security and development for several decades. They are developers at heart and understand that security is often a side-concern. They’ve also evolved work habits that enable them to develop systems in a way that promotes security while focusing on high-quality design habits – something that’s easier for developers to keep in mind during their daily work. Both are established international speakers and often present at conferences on topics regarding high-quality development and security.

 ``2018:``   ``Bug``   ``Bounty``   ``Frans``   ``Rosén``   ``Mattias``   ``Karlsson`**

Eliminating False Assumptions in Bug Bounties with Mattias Karlsson and Frans Rosén, October 2nd, 2018

OWASP Stockholm, Klarna, HackerOne, Mathias & Frans will during this event focus on bug bounty. HackerOne and Klarna will speak from an organisation perspective and Mathias and Frans will talk from a security researcher perspective. Klarna has started their journey and will speak about their experience. The good stuff that came out, but also lessons learned.

[Mattias Karlsson & Frans Rosén presentation]

Eliminating False Assumptions in Bug Bounties

There are a lot of illusions and misconceptions around the bug bounty industry. Is it too late to join? Are all the vulnerabilities already found? Is everything automated nowadays so there's no way to be late to the party?

Frans and Mathias have been in the mythical world of bounties for a few years and will share their thoughts and ideas on how to actually approach it technically, methodologically and mentally. And also, how to use bug bounties for your own advantage, to improve your career and to increase your pentesting and vulnerability hunting skills.

Tomas Karlsson
Tomas har över 20 års erfarenhet av system- och verksamhetsutveckling och har jobbat i många olika projektroller. Med den erfarenheten har han en stor förståelse för varför projekt fortsätter att leverera osäker kod. Intresset för säkerhet vaknade för några år sedan när Tomas upptäckte att han själv hade skrivit kod som, på fel ställe, hade kunna vara ett allvarligt säkerhetshål.

Sebastian Åkerman

Sebastian Åkerman är utvecklare och mjukvaruarkitekt och har jobbat som konsult med säkerhetskririsk systemutveckling i drygt 20 år. Sebastian har ett särskilt intresse för säkerhet i utvecklingsprocessen och är även co-lead för OWASP Stockholm. 



Beskrivning av OWASP top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a powerful awareness document for web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list.

We urge all companies to adopt this awareness document within their organization and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Adopting the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces secure code.

Abstract for Jim´s talk:

**Web Application Access Control Design Excellence**

Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer
within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key
access control anti-patterns commonly found during website security
audits. These access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security
policies, lack of horizontal access control, and "fail open" access
control mechanisms. In reviewing these and other access control
problems, we will discuss and design a positive access control mechanism
that is data contextual, activity based, configurable, flexible, and
deny-by-default - among other positive design attributes that make up a
robust web-based access-control mechanism.

 ``08:44,``   ``19``   ``Dec``   ``2007``   ``(EDT)`**

Today the Swedish national IT newspaper 'Computer Sweden' published an
article on the new OWASP-Sweden chapter - [*Mecka för säker
programmering till
Sverige*](http://computersweden.idg.se/2.2683/1.137387), or *A Mecka for
Secure Programming Reaches Sweden* in English. While OWASP is more than
a programmer's guide, Mattias Bergling and I are very happy to get the
news out to a large part of Sweden's IT industry.
