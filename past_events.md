Scapy in 0x30 Minutes by Guillaume Valadon

Joining us remotely, Guillaume is a Cybersecurity Researcher at GitGuardian. He likes looking at data and crafting packets. In his spare time, he co-maintains Scapy and learns reversing embedded devices. Also, he still remembers what AT+MS=V34 means! Guillaume regularly gives technical presentations, classes and live demonstrations, and write research papers for conferences and magazines.

Scapy (https://www.scapy.net & https://github.com/secdev/scapy) is a powerful Python-based interactive packet manipulation program and library. It can be used to forge or decode packets for a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more. This presentation will describe its main features step by step, and will give you hints to experiment by yourself.

Offensive security in the AI revolution by Dr. Emre Süren

Dr. Emre Süren is a researcher at Cybercampus Sweden, the National Cybersecurity Research Center. As the manager of the Royal Hacking Lab, he leads research teams focused on LLM security, IoT hacking, threat intelligence, and memory forensics. In addition to his research, he teaches digital forensics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Vulnerability research on the AI attack surface is not just important—it is the thin line between innovation and catastrophe. The AI revolution has granted everyone unprecedented power, so the arm race is on between whitehat and blackhat actors. By embedding AI into the core of vulnerability research, we don’t just strengthen digital defenses—we redefine resilience. This presentation will explore real-world examples of how mainstream LLMs can be poisoned and will introduce the research currently being conducted in our lab to uncover weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.

You’ll also get an insight into strategies for mitigation of AI introduced threats.

**`OWASP``   ``Stockholm``   ``meeting,``   ``September``   ``24``
 ``2024:``   ``OWASP``   ``Autumn OWASP meet up and after-work near Odenplan`**
 
Now that summer is over and autumn has come it's time for us to hang out and have a beer. This is the perfect opportunity for all of us app-sec interested folks to get together and meet up in real life for a relaxed chat and maybe a beer or some other refreshments.

**`OWASP``   ``Stockholm``   ``meeting,``   ``May``   ``21``
 ``2024:``   ``OWASP``   ``OWASP Stockholm - The EU Cyber Resilience Act and why the SBOM is so important`**
 
EU is about to become a market leader in software cybersecurity regulation. With a large set of proposed and active laws, software development will be regulated like never before.

With the coming EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) all software and embedded systems will have to get a CE mark, which is now expanded to include cybersecurity aspects. It’s going to be a huge change and will mean that the manufacturers (and in some cases importers) will get responsibility for the user’s security and will have to provide free security patches for the lifetime of the product. Software developers will have to learn secure coding and the need for cyber security professionals will be very high.

One of the focus areas is vulnerability management. To keep a product secure during its lifetime, all 3rd party components will have to be monitored and up to date. At the heart of this process is the Software Bill of Materials, SBOM, which is used to monitor for known vulnerabilities in both Open Source and commercial components. The OWASP CycloneDX project fits right in and have been working with various kinds of bill-of-materials for a long time. CycloneDX is in the process of becoming an ECMA standard and thus fits better in to the EU regulation.

In this talk Olle E. Johansson will introduce the proposed EU CRA legislation and talk about the SBOM with a focus on the toolchain needed to manage vulnerabilities.

We will start the evening with a mingle at 17:30 followed by a presentation that will start at 18:00. The talk will be around 1 hour long followed by a further mingle/time for questions and answers.

**Olle E. Johansson**
Olle E. Johansson is a consultant in the area of realtime communication and in embedded system security. He has been active in Open Source for many years as a developer, evangelist, trainer and speaker in many conferences worldwide. Olle is a member of the OWASP SBOM Forum and the OWASP CycloneDX industry working group. He is currently working on the CycloneDX Transparency Exchange API standard. Olle is currently a project leader for the Swedish DNS TAPIR project that is building Open Source software for analysing DNS resolver logs and finding bad actors.

 ``2024:``   ``OWASP``   ``Resilience, APIs and Web Security @ Akamai`**
 
Welcome to an evening with focus on resilience, APIs, and web security!
The meetup will start with a mingle (wraps/drinks) at 17:30, the main presentations begins at 18:00. The talks will also be streamed online from 18:00.

**Architecting web applications to achieve DDoS resiliency - Johan Aldor**
In this session, Johan Aldor, Senior Solutions Engineer from Akamai will cover how to architect web applications to achieve DDoS resiliency. DDoS attacks are getting more common and also bigger, if you don’t architecture your web application correctly, coping with attacks can be a hassle. Akamai has over 25 years of experience in running distributed systems and overlay networks. Join us in this session where we share the benefits of using a distributed architecture for DNS, Web Application Firewalls and datacenter protection that will make you ready for any attack.

**API Security is NOT Appsec - Alexander Cedergren**
API Security has become a hot topic and this is what you need to know about it. OWASP recently released the updated OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks, and to be secure you need to rethink your normal security strategy. Join Alexander Cedergren, Senior Solutions Engineer at Akamai to learn more about why API Security is NOT AppSec, and what needs to be done different now when APIs is dominating the modern world.


**`OWASP``   ``Stockholm``   ``meeting,``   ``Jan``   ``17``
 ``2024:``   ``OWASP``   ``OWASP Top 10 for LLM:s`**
 
Artificial Intelligence is reshaping nearly every sector and will influence our society in ways that we are only now starting to comprehend. Rapid evolvement of tools, methods, and novel approaches is prompting businesses to swiftly adopt fresh solutions to harness the potential of this emerging paradigm. However, as new technologies, methodologies, and work practices are introduced, hackers also adapt and innovate, always staying one step ahead.
This session led by cybersecurity specialist Krister Hedfors will explore the techniques that hackers use to leverage, manipulate, and exploit GenAI systems, such as ChatGPT and Code Llama. He will also give an introduction to OWASP top 10 list for Large Language Models (LLM).


**`OWASP``   ``Stockholm``   ``meeting,``   ``Dec``   ``13``
 ``2023:``   ``OWASP``   ``Pub evening - Lucia OWASP meet up and after-work near Odenplan`**

**`OWASP``   ``Stockholm``   ``meeting,``   ``Sep``   ``28``
 ``2023:``   ``OWASP``   ``Pub evening - OWASP meet up and after-work near Odenplan`**
 
While the summer holidays may be behind us, there's no reason to stop the fun. This is the perfect opportunity for all of us app-sec interested folks to get together and meet up in real life for a relaxed chat and maybe a beer or some other refreshments.


**`OWASP``   ``Stockholm``   ``meeting,``   ``Mar``   ``2``
 ``2023:``   ``OWASP``   ``DDoS attacks against Sweden- what happened and what we can do about it`**
 
During the month of February social media accounts have repeatedly threatened Sweden with cyberattacks. The threats realized in the form of Distributed Denial-of-service attacks, a type of attack aiming at disrupting normal operations and availability of online services and websites. As a result, several Swedish websites were affected, but thankfully not nation-critical services.

DDoS attacks are on the rise on a global scale. They are used by organized crime to blackmail organizations, as well as nation state actors to attack infrastructure of other countries, often opportunistically under the cover of political events.

For this event we get together to discuss what happened, but more importantly what we can do to protect the organizations we work for against DDoS attacks.

The event will be held using huddle in Slack so make sure to join the channel “#chapter-stockholm”.
 

**`OWASP``   ``Stockholm``   ``meeting,``   ``Dec``   ``6``
 ``2022:``   ``OWASP``   ``DevSecOps with GitHub Advanced Security`**

Developers are expected to build secure code, but traditional security tools have been difficult to integrate into the development process. Recent studies show that 85% of applications still contain known vulnerabilities. (https://codesentry.grammatech.com/wp-form-osterman-research)

With GitHub Advanced Security we have the possibility to natively embed security directly into the development workflow. This allows for detection of vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.

Join us on December 6th where we will go through the different GitHub Advanced Security features like Code scanning using CodeQL, Secret scanning and Dependecy scanning with Dependabot.

About Presenter: Sanjin Medic, Principal Architect and Head of Development at Solidify

We are hosted by Micrsosoft Reactor @ Regeringsgatan 59, Stockholm

 ``2022:``   ``OWASP``   ``DevSecOps with GitLab Security`**

Welcome to another live OWASP Stockholm event and get together sponsored by Sentor

Cyber attacks have never been more in the news. From Twitter hacks to identity theft, vulnerabilities are exposing gaps in the application development process. Application security is difficult, especially when security is a separate process from your DevOps workflow. Security has traditionally been the final hurdle to conquer in the development lifecycle.

Join this session to gain a better understanding of how to successfully shift security left to find and fix security flaws during development - and to do so more easily and with greater visibility and control than typical approaches can provide.

Stefania will explore:

* How to achieve comprehensive security scanning - without adding a bunch of new tools and processes
* How to secure and protect your cloud native applications and IaC environments within existing DevOps workflows
* How to use a single-source-of-truth to improve collaboration between dev and sec
* How to manage all of your software vulnerabilities in one place
* How to automate and monitor your security policies and simplify auditing
* How to set up compliance pipelines to provide consistent guardrails for developers and ensure separation of duties

This meeting will be both physical and virtual, therefore it is important that you register for the correct event. Choose the physical event if you will be attending in person to see Stefania's presentation or choose the virtual event if you will be watching the presentation online through a zoom meeting.

Klarna has started their journey and will speak about their experience. The good stuff that came out, but also lessons learned.

[Mattias Karlsson & Frans Rosén presentation]

Eliminating False Assumptions in Bug Bounties

There are a lot of illusions and misconceptions around the bug bounty industry. Is it too late to join? Are all the vulnerabilities already found? Is everything automated nowadays so there's no way to be late to the party?

Frans and Mathias have been in the mythical world of bounties for a few years and will share their thoughts and ideas on how to actually approach it technically, methodologically and mentally. And also, how to use bug bounties for your own advantage, to improve your career and to increase your pentesting and vulnerability hunting skills.

Med den erfarenheten har han en stor förståelse för varför projekt fortsätter att leverera osäker kod. Intresset för säkerhet vaknade för några år sedan när Tomas upptäckte att han själv hade skrivit kod som, på fel ställe, hade kunna vara ett allvarligt säkerhetshål.

Sebastian Åkerman

Sebastian Åkerman är utvecklare och mjukvaruarkitekt och har jobbat som konsult med säkerhetskririsk systemutveckling i drygt 20 år. Sebastian har ett särskilt intresse för säkerhet i utvecklingsprocessen och är även co-lead för OWASP Stockholm. 



Beskrivning av OWASP top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a powerful awareness document for web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. Project members include a variety of security experts from around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list.

We urge all companies to adopt this awareness document within their organization and start the process of ensuring that their web applications minimize these risks. Adopting the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture within your organization into one that produces secure code.

Abstract for Jim´s talk:

**Web Application Access Control Design Excellence**

Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer
within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key
access control anti-patterns commonly found during website security
audits. These access control anti-patterns include hard-coded security
policies, lack of horizontal access control, and "fail open" access
control mechanisms. In reviewing these and other access control
problems, we will discuss and design a positive access control mechanism
that is data contextual, activity based, configurable, flexible, and
deny-by-default - among other positive design attributes that make up a
robust web-based access-control mechanism.
