Securing the CI in CI/CD: From Developer's Machine to Artifact Promotion
In this presentation, we will explore the security aspects of Continuous Integration (CI) within the CI/CD pipeline, focusing on protecting the entire process from the developer's machine to artifact promotion and repository. We will go through the various stages of CI, identify potential security threats, and discuss effective mitigations to ensure a secure and robust CI environment.

Guarding the Prompt: Building a Firewall for LLMs Aligned with the OWASP Top 10
This session explores how AI firewalls can effectively mitigate the OWASP Top 10 threats for large language models (LLMs). We'll break down each risk, showcase practical defense strategies, and present a live demo of an AI firewall in action. Attendees will gain insights into securing LLM applications, understanding real-world attack scenarios, and adopting proactive measures to future-proof AI systems. Whether you're building with or securing AI, this talk offers valuable takeaways to strengthen your generative AI security posture.
