Chapters are led by local leaders in accordance with the [Chapter Leader Guidebook](/www-policy/guidebook/chapter-leader). Financial contributions should only be made online using the authorized online donation button. To be a SPEAKER at ANY OWASP Chapter in the world simply review the [speaker agreement](/www-policy/legal/speaker-agreement) and then contact the local chapter leader with details of what OWASP Project, independent research, or related software security topic you would like to present.
